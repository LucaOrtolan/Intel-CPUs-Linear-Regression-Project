# Intel-CPUs-Linear-Regression-Project

The purpose of this project is to analyze data regarding Intel CPUs and to develop a linear regression model that can predict their market prices using as independent variables their specifications such as the number or cores and their maximum clock speed. 
The data has been webscraped from Intel's website https://ark.intel.com/content by using the BeautifulSoup and selenium libraries.
The notebook shows all the project's phases: data collection, preprocessing, visual analysis and, lastly, the regression model. 
The unprocessed data can be found in the csv file.

Libraries used: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, BeautifulSoup, selenium, matplotlib and seaborn.
