# Intel-CPUs-Linear-Regression-Project

The purpose of this project is to analyze data regarding Intel CPUs and to develop a linear regression model that can predict their market prices using as independent variables their specifications such as the number or cores and their maximum clock speed. <br />
The data has been webscraped from Intel's website https://ark.intel.com/content by using the BeautifulSoup and selenium libraries.<br />
The notebook shows all the project's phases: data collection, preprocessing, visual analysis and, lastly, the regression model. <br />
The unprocessed data can be found in the csv file.

Libraries used: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, BeautifulSoup, selenium, matplotlib and seaborn.
